## Introduction
The Top Gun Quiz is an engaging and interactive web-based quiz game that tests the player's knowledge about the iconic movie "Top Gun."

## Goal
The goal is to create an entertaining web-based  trivia quiz. I choose the Top Gun franchise as it's my favourtite film! Furthermore with the release of Maverick it has undergone a revival and so will appeal to a range of age groups.
